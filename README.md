Let's make a simplified version of Hacker News.

Once again, don't worry about users logging in yet - we'll get to that very soon!

Here are your stories:

* As a user, I want to post a link, so that I can share it with other nerds.

* As a user, I want to vote up other people's links, so that I can promote links that I like.

_incomplete work on upvoting links_

* As a user, I want the links with the most votes to be listed first, so that I can know what's most popular.

* As a user, I want the link ranking to be a function of both the number of votes and the time since the post, so that popular links don't stay on the homepage forever. Hint: come up with a way to score links where they get a certain number of points for how new they are, and a certain number for how many votes they have. Don't spend too much time fussing with the algorithm - just make up something simple.
